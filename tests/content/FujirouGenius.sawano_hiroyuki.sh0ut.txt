[SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:Tielle & Gemie「sh0ut」歌詞]

[Intro: Tielle]
Time has come to listen to the
Crying of their puppet souls

[Verse 1: Tielle, Gemie]
君がそんなにもっと楽をして
行き詰まった未来と合図
Words are strong, heart is dropped, scatter around and falls
偽りのcontact-everything
誘い込んだ傷が混ざる
誰も忘れた悲しみが fall out

[Pre-Chorus: Gemie, Tielle]
偽名はただ凍る 希望のジレンマ
息削ぎ落とす行動も抑える
そう解っている答えなど捨ててしまえ

[Chorus: Tielle, Gemie]
Yeah, get started breaking the row
See how it spreads out, it's beyond full real-ization
Yeah, get started re-creating the world
Take my hands till the end, feel this raw-raw emotion

[Post-Chorus: Tielle, Gemie]
Bring it on down rock, rock, rock
Shake it up, up, tap, top, top
'Cause I know how to shout out my soul
Bring it on down rock, rock, rock
Shake it up, up, tap, top, top
'Cause you know how to shout out your soul

[Verse 2: Gemie, Tielle]
I've got a feeling, you must let me go
I wanna keep my faith forever
Words are alive, supporting us, connecting with the souls
I'm gonna fight them all to let you go
I wanna seek my way to answer
Words are alive, supporting us, connecting with the souls

[Pre-Chorus: Gemie]
You know what? We look up to the sky, count on it
And halos in the clouds light me up, then I awake
In the heat, get fired up, you'll call my name

[Chorus: Gemie, Tielle]
Yeah, get started breaking the row
See how it spreads out, it's beyond full real-ization
Yeah, get started re-creating the world
Take my hands till the end, feel this raw-raw emotion

[Post-Chorus: Gemie, Tielle]
Bring it on down rock, rock, rock
Shake it up, up, tap, top, top
'Cause I know how to shout out my soul
Bring it on down rock, rock, rock
Shake it up, up, tap, top, top
'Cause you know how to shout out your soul

[Bridge: Gemie, Tielle]
偽名はただ凍る 希望のジレンマ
息削ぎ落とす行動も抑える
そう解っている答えなど捨ててしまえ

[Chorus: Gemie, Tielle]
Yeah, get started breaking the row
See how it spreads out, it's beyond full real-ization
Yeah, get started re-creating the world
Take my hands till the end, feel this raw-raw emotion

[Post-Chorus: Gemie, Tielle]
Bring it on down rock, rock, rock
Shake it up, up, tap, top, top
'Cause I know how to shout out my soul
Bring it on down rock, rock, rock
Shake it up, up, tap, top, top
'Cause you know how to shout out your soul

[Outro: Tielle]
Time has come to listen to the
Crying of their puppet souls
