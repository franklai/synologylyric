Taylor Swift - Forever & Always (Taylor's Version)


[Verse 1]
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto somethin'
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kiddin'?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please, tell me
'Cause, one second, it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always," oh
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"

[Verse 2]
Was I out of line?
Did I say somethin' way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothin'
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always," oh
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"

[Post-Chorus]
You didn't mean it, baby
I don't think so
Oh, woah

[Bridge]
Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

[Chorus]
'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all
And you flashback to when we said, "Forever and always"
And it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"

[Outro]
You didn't mean it, baby
You said, "Forever and always," yeah
